Accretion
Adding on
Allow an easement (an easement is the abandonment of a stricture)

Always give yourself credit for having more than personality (given by Arto Lindsay)
Always the first steps

Do we need holes?
Don't avoid what is easy
Don't be frightened of cliches

Dont be frightened to display your talents
Emphasize differences
Emphasize repetitions
Emphasize the flaws
Faced with a choice, do both (from Dieter Rot)
Feed the recording back out of the medium
Fill every beat with something
Find a safe part and use it as an anchor
Get your neck massaged
Ghost echoes
Give way to your worst impulse

Go slowly all the way round the outside

Idiot glee
Imagine the piece as a set of disconnected events
In total darkness, or in a very large room, very quietly
Infinitesimal gradations
Into the impossible
Is it finished?
Is something missing?
Is the information correct?
Is the style right?
Is there something missing
It is quite possible (after all)
It is simply a matter of work
Left channel, right channel, center channel
Listen to the quiet voice
Look at the order in which you do things
Look closely at the most embarrassing details & amplify them
Lost in useless territory
Lowest common denominator
Magnify the most difficult details

Make a sudden, destructive unpredictable action; incorporate
Make an exhaustive list of everything you might do & do the last thing on the list
Make it more sensual
Make what's perfect more human
Mechanicalize something idiosyncratic
Move towards the unimportant
Mute and continue
Not building a wall but making a brick
Once the search has begun, something will be found
Only a part, not the whole
Only one element of each kind
Openly resist change
Put in earplugs
Question the heroic

Remove specifics and convert to ambiguities

Think -inside the work -outside the work
Think of the radio
Tidy up
Towards the insignificant
Trust in the you of now
Try faking it (from Stewart Brand)
Turn it upside down
Twist the spine
Use an old idea
Use an unacceptable color
Use fewer notes
Use filters
Use something nearby as a model
Voice your suspicions
Water
What are the sections sections of? Imagine a caterpillar moving
What are you really thinking about just now?
What context would look right?
What is the reality of the situation?
What is the simplest solution?
What mistakes did you make last time?
What to increase? What to reduce? What to maintain?
What were you really thinking about just now?
What would your closest friend do?
What wouldn't you do?
When is it for?
Where is the edge?
Which parts can be grouped?
Work at a different speed
Would anyone want it?
You are an engineer
You can only make one dot at a time
You don't have to be ashamed of using your own ideas
